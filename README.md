# Kotlin-Project3
Kotlin homework 3 for my Advanced Engineering School classes

Task 1: Refine the example with the loop 'while' - transform it into an infinite loop with the exit being an input string 'Exit'
Task 2: Refine the example with the loop 'for' - handle the situation with entering a negative number
Task 3: Refine the example with 'if… else' - if the user enters a value outside the range 0-100, display the message 'incorrect value entered' 
and ask to repeat the input (use a loop)
Task 4: Implement a remote control: the user enters the channel number, the program outputs the channel name. Exit the program by entering “0". Use an array.

Additional task:
Use the switch statement and loops to implement a program that displays a menu:
1. Enter your name
2. Enter your last name
3. Enter the year of birth
4. Output information
0. Exit
The user enters the number of the menu item in the console.
The first three items take the corresponding values in the console. Calling the fourth item outputs to the console the summary information 
“Name: entered first name, Last name: entered last name, year of birth: entered year”.
When the zero point is called, the program shuts down.
