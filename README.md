# Kotlin-Project3
Kotlin homework 3 for my Advanced Engineering School classes.
* Additional tasks

CONDITIONAL OPERATORS:
1. The user enters a number in the console. If it is greater than 10, we output a message “The number is greater than ten”, if less – “The number is less than ten”
2. The user enters two numbers in the console, we output the message “the first number is greater / less than the second” depending on the result of their comparison
3. The user enters the lengths of the sides of the triangle (three numbers) in the console, we output a message whether the triangle is isosceles, equilateral or versatile.
4. The user enters four numbers in the console. We calculate and output it to the console the number of negative and positive numbers
5. The user enters three numbers in the console, we output the largest of them.
6. The user enters three numbers in the console. We calculate and output to the console the sum of the largest and smallest of them
7. The user enters a number in the console. We output a message about whether the number is even or odd
8. The program “Shop”, we display a menu of three products with prices. The user selects the product, enters the amount of money. 
9. If the amount is less than the price, we display the message: “There is not enough money!”, if the amount is equal to the price – “Thanks for the purchase!”, if more – “Your change: [change amount]”


LOOPS:
1. Output the multiplication table by 4 to the console
2. The user enters a number - x. Output all even numbers from zero to x to the console
3. The user enters a number - x. Output a number from the Fibonacci sequence with the index x
4. The user enters a number. Output the factorial of this number to the console
5. The user enters a string. We output this line to the console character by character (one line – one character)


ARRAYS
1. An array with integers is given. Output to the console the number of positive and negative numbers in it
2. An array with integers is given. Output the sum of elements with even indexes to the console
3. An array with integers is given. Output the sum of even elements (even values) to the console
4. An array with integers is given. Output the largest of them to the console
5. An array with integers is given. Output the most common values to the console. 
If there are several of them, then output the largest of them, if there are no duplicates, output the corresponding message.
6. A two-dimensional 10x10 array with integers is given. Output to the console all numbers diagonally from [0][0] to [10][10]
7. A two-dimensional 10x10 array with integers is given. Output to the console all numbers diagonally from [0][10] to [10][0]
8. A two-dimensional 5x5 array with integers is given. Calculate the sum of the numbers in each column and output the largest of them
